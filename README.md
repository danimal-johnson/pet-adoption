## Pure React.
No compile step. No JSX. No Babel. No Webpack. No parcel. **Just JavaScript**

Notes:
* The `root` div can be called anything. This is just a convention.
* `React.createElement()` is what is doing all the heavy lifting in the background, like converting JSX.
* Capitalization is important. Self-named things must start with a capital. Things that start with a capital are assumed to be built-in.
